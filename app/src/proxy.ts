 * cookie alone answers "is this request signed in?" without a DB round trip on
 * every navigation.
 *
 * The `authorized` callback in auth.config.ts decides what is public — see
 * `PUBLIC_ROUTES` there: `/` (marketing), `/login`, `/register` and
 * `/api/auth/*`. Everything else, `/dashboard` included, requires a session.

 * Wraps the auth middleware to CLEAR an unreadable session cookie.
 *
 * Auth.js throws `JWTSessionError: no matching decryption secret` when the
 * cookie cannot be decrypted — typically because it was encrypted with a
 * different AUTH_SECRET, or it is truncated. It then degrades to "signed out",
 * which is correct, but the browser keeps sending the same dead cookie on
 * every request: the error repeats forever and the log fills with stack traces.
 *
 * If we end up treating the request as signed out while a session cookie is
 * still present, that cookie is useless — so delete it. The next request is
 * clean and signing in issues a fresh one. Without this, a user whose cookie
 * predates a secret change has to clear site data by hand to recover.
